Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
The build failed due to secrets scanning detecting secrets in the build output files during the build process.

The error message in the logs indicates that "Secrets scanning found secrets in build."

### Solution
1. **Review and Remove Secrets**: Review the files mentioned in the log where the secrets were found, such as `dist/public/assets/index-D22Fw9j6.js`, to remove the hardcoded secrets.
2. **Prevent Exposure of Secrets**: To prevent exposing secrets, make sure that sensitive information like API keys and secret keys are not hardcoded in the build output files.
3. **Utilize Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to securely store and access sensitive information like API keys and secret keys. Ensure that the secrets are not directly included in the build files.
4. **Update Configuration (if necessary)**: If the secrets are expected and should not be flagged as errors, configure `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS`, `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS`, or `SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED` to prevent detecting them during the build process.
5. **Verify Node.js Version**: Ensure that the Node.js version specified in the configuration is compatible with the project. If there are node version mismatches, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) for changing Node versions.
6. **External Configuration (if required)**: If any external packages or files are needed for the build, verify that the package is in `package.json` or the file was committed to the repository before adding them to external configurations.

By following these steps, you can address the issue of secrets being detected during the build process and prevent the failure due to secret exposures.
